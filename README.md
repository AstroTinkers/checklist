# checklist
Simple checklist program to help you when sorting stuff.
Everything you enter will bring a message telling you that the item either it's been added to the list or that it's already in the list.
To exit press "q"
If you have any items in your list they will be sorted and the list will be saved as "Results.txt" in the directory of the executable file.
No file will be created if your list is empty.
There are no viruses in the file, but your Antivirus software may still be nervous about it...
